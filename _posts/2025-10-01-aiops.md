## Introduction

More and more *mala xiangguo* shops are opened in Singapore. Some Chinese
restaurants that used to sell different things started to sell mala xiangguo. I
did not get surprised actually, because mala xiangguo may be one of the dishes
that can be easily **standardized** in the process, and consequently, generates
better ROI than the other types of Chinese food that usually makes restaurant
struggle in the middle between *expanding varieties* and *maintaining operation
cost*. Different from the fast food, mala xiangguo is always cooked with the
flavour that the eaters choose by themselves.

<font size="1">Mala xiangguo becomes vastly popular in Singapore. It attracts
food-lovers from not only the local but also those from abroad. It is different
from fast food but serves with super high efficiency and full of
flavours.</font>

This is how I got inspired to write this post. 

## The Analogy: Mala Xiang Guo as an Ops System

In the world of enterprise AI, “Ops” often sounds less glamorous than algorithms
or models. Yet, in practice, it’s **Ops that turns intelligence into
impact**—the invisible force that makes AI reliable, reproducible, and scalable.
Let's make a comparative study between the Ops in AI systems and the familiar
scene that anyone from China, Singapore, or elsewhere in Asia can relate to: a
bustling *mala xiang guo* (or literally, ``dumb-spicy hot pot'') restaurant.

A *mala xiang guo* restaurant operates with remarkable efficiency. Customers
pick their favorite ingredients—meat, tofu, mushrooms, vegetables—and hand them
to the counter. Minutes later, their customized bowl arrives, perfectly balanced
in flavor and texture, regardless of the ingredients chosen.  

The secret is not in the chef's improvisation, but in the **Ops system**: a set
of **standard operating procedures (SOPs)** that ensure every bowl is delicious,
consistent, and fast to prepare. The sauces, heat levels, and cooking steps are
predefined. The process is so well-designed that **complexity at the front end
(customer variety)** doesn’t translate into complexity at the back end (kitchen
operation).  

This is exactly how modern AI systems should work.

## Outcome-Driven Efficiency

The *mala xiang guo* process focuses on outcome—the final taste—rather than
every micro-step of the cooking. In AI terms, this corresponds to how **MLOps,
DataOps, and LLMOps** focus on reducing friction in the path toward the desired
outcome—accurate, deployable, and adaptive models. Ops minimizes the effort
needed to achieve consistent results. A well-designed Ops framework lets teams
experiment, customize, and deploy without reinventing the workflow each
time—just like chefs adding new ingredients without rewriting the recipe.

## Standardization Without Uniformity

As *W. Edwards Deming* noted,  
> “Standardization does not mean that we all wear the same color … Homes of
> infinite variety of design are built with a few types of bricks … with
> standard dimensions.”

Each customer’s bowl is unique, yet the process to make it is standard.  
Similarly, enterprise AI systems must handle diverse data and models while
maintaining **standardized pipelines**—from data ingestion to deployment. When
a new data source or model variant is introduced, the pipeline shouldn’t break;
it should **absorb the new element** through defined interfaces and validated
steps, much like the *mala xiang guo* wok that harmonizes tofu, beef, and lotus
root in a single sizzling blend.

## Modular and Hierarchical Design

Behind the simplicity of the dish lies a modular process: ingredients are
grouped (meat, vegetables, tofu) and cooked according to their nature before
combining. This modularization mirrors how AI systems categorize data types,
model components, and workflows. Such design allows **parallelization** and
**decentralized orchestration**, keeping the system efficient even when
complexity grows. This is not just cooking—it’s **pipeline engineering** in
disguise.

## Freshness and Customization

*Mala xiang guo* is never precooked. Each dish is made to order—reflecting the
customer’s current taste. Likewise, AI models that continuously learn from fresh
data deliver relevance and responsiveness, to tackle the domain-specific
problems. Ops enables this freshness: through **automated retraining,
monitoring, and deployment**, enterprises can serve up insights as fresh as the
ingredients in a wok.

## Conclusion

Ops turns intelligence into an engine of value. Just as *mala xiang guo*
transforms diverse ingredients into a harmonious meal through precise execution,
**AI Ops** unifies data, models, and infrastructure into a consistent outcome
that serves business goals. In the end, intelligence without Ops is like raw
ingredients without a wok—potential without flavor.  

To make custom AI truly useful in the enterprise, **Ops is still all you need.**
