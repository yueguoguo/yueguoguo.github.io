# How a machine learning engineering is performed

* A model is built.
* The model is built by using raw materials (data) generated from various
  sources. 
* The raw data need to be featurized before it can be used for model building.
* The model training process requires parameter tuning to optimize the training
  objective. 
* The model is evaluated against the pre-defined quantitaive metrics.
* The training process can be repeated. 
* Data visualization is vital to building a reliable model. 
* A pipeline with engineering best practices is needed for efficiency
  enhancement. 
* The pipeline is automated at large but it still requires human involvement.
* The model needs to be monitored all the time.
* When the model is online, sometimes a hot-fix is urgently required.
* The platforms that are used to host the models should be scalable and flexible.

# How babysitting is performed

* A baby is raised.
* The baby is raised by using the raw materials (milk) generated from various
  sources (mommy and formula milk powder).
* The raw materials need to be featurized, e.g., heated, mixed with water,
  bottled, etc., before it can be used for baby feeding. 
* The babysitting process requires parents' technique tuning to optimize the
  feeding experience. 
* The baby's growth is evaluated by the pre-defined quantitative metrics, i.e.,
  the WHO baby growth standard. 
* The babysitting process is repeated (every 3 hours a day) for feed-play-sleep.
* The activity information visualization is vital to babysitting.
* A pipeline with the engineering best practices (using the established tools
  such as auto formula milk maker machine, the UV sterilizer, etc., applying the
  5-min burping technique, etc.) is needed for efficiency enhancement. 
* The pipeline can be automated at larget but still it requires human
  involvement... 
* The baby needs to be monitored all the time. 
* When the baby is awake, sometimes a hot-fix is urgently required (change of
  the diaper!!!)
* The crib/clothes/stroller that are used by the baby should be scalable and
  flexible (the baby grows so fast!)
