| A model is built.                                                                        | A baby is cared.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| The model is built by using raw materials (data) generated from various sources          | The baby is raised by using the raw materials (milk) generated from various sources (mommy and formula milk powder)                                                                                   |
| The raw data need to be featurized before it can be used for model building.             | The raw materials need to be featurized, e.g., heated, mixed with water, bottled, etc., before it can be used for baby feeding.                                                                       |
| The model training process requires parameter tuning to optimize the training objective. | The babysitting process requires parents' technique tuning to optimize the feeding experience.                                                                                                        |
| The model is evaluated against the pre-defined quantitaive metrics.                      | The baby's growth is evaluated by the pre-defined quantitative metrics, i.e., the WHO baby growth standard.                                                                                           |
| The model can be repetitively retrained.                                                 | The babysitting process can be repetitive (every 3 hours a day) for feed-play-sleep.                                                                                                                  |
| Data visualization is vital to building a reliable model.                                | The activity information visualization is vital to babysitting.                                                                                                                                       |
| A pipeline with engineering best practices is needed for efficiency enhancement.         | A pipeline with the engineering best practices (using the auto formula milk maker machine, the UV sterilizer, etc., applying the 5-min burping technique, etc.) is needed for efficiency enhancement. |
| The pipeline is automated at large but it still requires human involvement.              | The pipeline can be automated at larget but still it requires human involvement...                                                                                                                    |
| The model needs to be monitored it is alive.                                             | The baby needs to be monitored ALL THE TIME.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Sometimes a hot-fix is urgently required to resolve the model issue.                     | Many times a hot-fix (e.g., soothie pacifier, change of diaper, etc.) is urgently required to resolve the baby issues.                                                                                |
| The platforms that are used to host the models should be scalable and flexible.          | The crib/clothes/stroller that are used by the baby should be scalable and flexible (the baby grows so fast!)                                                                                         |
