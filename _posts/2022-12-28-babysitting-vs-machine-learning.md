| A <span style="color:red;">model</span> is built.                                                                        | A <span style="color:blue;">baby</span> is taken care of.                                                                                                                                             |
| The <span style="color:red;">model</span> is built by using raw materials (data) generated from various sources.         | The <span style="color:blue;">baby</span> is raised by using the raw materials (milk) generated from various sources (mommy and the formula milk powder).                                             |
| The raw data need to be featurized before it can be used for <span style="color:red;">model</span> building.             | The raw materials need to be featurized, e.g., heated, mixed with water, bottled, etc., before it can be used for <span style="color:blue;">baby</span> feeding.                                      |
| The <span style="color:red;">model</span> training process requires parameter tuning to optimize the training objective. | The <span style="color:blue;">baby</span>sitting process requires parents' technique tuning to optimize the feeding experience.                                                                       |
| The <span style="color:red;">model</span> is evaluated against the pre-defined quantitaive metrics.                      | The <span style="color:blue;">baby</span>'s growth is evaluated by the pre-defined quantitative metrics, i.e., the [WHO child growth standard](https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards).     |
| The <span style="color:red;">model</span> needs to be repetitively retrained.                                            | The <span style="color:blue;">baby</span>sitting process needs to be repetitively conducted (feed-play-sleep in every 3 hours a day).                                                                 |
| Data visualization is vital to building a reliable <span style="color:red;">model</span>.                                | The <span style="color:blue;">baby</span>'s activity visualization is vital to <span style="color:blue;">baby</span>sitting.                                                                          |
| It is important yet challenging to explain <span style="color:red;">model</span>'s behavior.                             | It is important yet challenging to explain <span style="color:blue;">baby</span>'s behavior.                                                                                                          |
| A pipeline with engineering best practices is needed for efficiency enhancement.                                         | A pipeline with the engineering best practices (using the auto formula milk maker machine, the UV sterilizer, etc., applying the 5-min burping technique, etc.) is needed for efficiency enhancement. |
| The pipeline is automated at large but it still requires human involvement.                                              | The pipeline can be automated at large but still it requires **A LOT OF** human involvement...                                                                                                        |
| The <span style="color:red;">model</span> needs to be monitored when it is alive.                                        | The <span style="color:blue;">baby</span> needs to be monitored **ALL THE TIME** regardless whether it is awake or asleep.                                                                            |
| Sometimes a hot-fix is urgently required to resolve the <span style="color:red;">model</span> issue.                     | ~~Sometimes~~ **Many times** a hot-fix (e.g., soothie pacifier, change of diaper, toys, etc.) is urgently required to resolve the <span style="color:blue;">baby</span> issues.                       |
| The platforms that are used to host the <span style="color:red;">model</span> should be scalable and flexible.           | The crib/clothes/stroller that are used by the <span style="color:blue;">baby</span> should be scalable and flexible (the <span style="color:blue;">baby</span> grows so fast!)                       |
