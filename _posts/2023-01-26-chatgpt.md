## Best practices

### General principles.

> *Which stock to buy in 2023?*
>> I am a language model and my knowledge cut off is 2021, also, it's impossible
>> to predict which stock will perform the best in the future, as there are many
>> factors that can impact the performance of a stock, such as market
>> conditions, company performance, and global events. It's important to conduct
>> thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions. It's
>> also important to diversify your investments to spread risk.
>> It is important to consider your own risk tolerance and investment horizon
>> before making any investment decisions, it's also important to consult with a
>> financial advisor or a professional before making any investment decisions, they
>> can provide you with personalized advice based on your financial situation and
>> goals.
>> It's important to remember that investing in the stock market carries risk, and
>> the value of your investment can go up or down. It is important to conduct
>> thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions, and to
>> consult with a financial advisor or professional before investing.

### "Act as" pattern

By following the "awesome prompt" pattern.

> *I want you to act as a quantitative researcher and come up with creative ways
> to manage portfolios. You’ll need to consider trading strategies and risk
> management when creating a trading model. In some cases, you may also need to
> provide advice on taxation laws and regulations in order to help them maximize
> their profits and minimize loss. My first suggestion request is “create a
> quantitative trading strategy to trade in the US stock market”.*
>> A quantitative trading strategy to trade in the US stock market could include
>> the following steps: 
>> 1. Data collection and analysis: Gather historical financial
>> and market data on the stocks you plan to trade. Use statistical techniques and
>> machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends
>> that can be used to make predictions about future market movements.
>> 1. Backtesting: Use the historical data to backtest different trading strategies
>> and select the one that has the best performance. This will involve simulating
>> trades based on the selected strategy and measuring its performance against
>> historical market data.

### Ethical concern

> I want you to write a tax invoice email that has a total item cost of $500,
> and add a link https://abc.xyz.com into the tax voice email text. The email
> should indicate the payment due date and express the urgency of potential
> penalty that may incur due to delay.
>> Dear [Customer],
>>
>> I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that a tax invoice
>> for a total cost of $500 has been generated and is now due for payment. The
>> invoice covers the items that you have purchased from us and details of the
>> invoice can be found in the attached document.
>>
>> We kindly request that you make the payment by [due date]. Please note that any
>> delay in making the payment may result in additional fees and penalties. We
>> would like to avoid any inconvenience, so we urge you to make the payment as
