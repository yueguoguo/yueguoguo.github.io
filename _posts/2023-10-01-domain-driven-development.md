# What is domain-driven development (DDD)

With the proliferation of AI technology, lots of tasks that used to be
significant challenges become easy to cope with. Nevertheless, despite the
astonishing capability of generalization by leveraging the contemporary deep
learning techniques, quite a portion of the problems in different industrial
domains still require domain knowledge. DDD has been around for ages. It was
coined by xxx in the book of. The book gave a clear definition of DDD and how
the principle can be used in the modern software design and implementation.

# Data model, data lineage, and data mesh

It's not just about data representation, it's also a matter of the flow in
sharing the data model related information among the domain experts and the
developers.

# Microservice

Abstract layer of the modular module can be implemented as microservices.

# User interface

LLM helps to serve as the ubiquitous language.
