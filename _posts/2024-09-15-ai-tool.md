## Vim to Cursor

The creator of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar), passed away
on 3rd of August, 2023. In the same year, [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), one of the most popular AI IDEs today, [raised
$20 million in Series A funding](https://www.cursor.com/blog/series-a), after it had been founded for one year. Before
the AI-assisted development tool arose, programmers had "respected" those who are able to code fast with their fingers,
and considered it as a sign of coding prowess. When I firstly saw my senior programmer typing code without leaving his
keyboard, I was amazed. It was so cool that he typed codes just like the hackers in the movies.

Today, the coolest way of programming seems no longer to be typing codes with
hotkeys completely on the keyboard, but to be merely clicking "tab" and "enter"
to generate codes with AI - tab to autocomplete and enter to generate/accept.
This is thanks to the proliferation of the large language models (LLMs) that are
used for coding efficiency improvement.

After my amazement, I started to wonder: what are the implications of this new
programming paradigm? What are the pros and cons?

## What do we gain and what do we lose?

### The gain is very observable

This is what I usually do when I am working on coding activities as a machine learning engineer without AI. 

1. Get a request of application or a feature from the client or the product manager.
1. Think about what I want to do, and how to do it. 
1. Open my IDE (without a loss of my heavy preference for Vim, I use VSCode with Vim emulation plugin).
1. Draw some sketches about what the code should look like - usually I do this with `mermaid` or `draw.io`.
1. Write down the thoughts into the `markdown` files.
1. Design and develop the structure of the code. Not actual code yet, but just the scaffolding. In Python, I use `poetry` for this.
1. Write the high-level interface and base classes. 
1. Write the actual functions and classes. I am a data scientist but I don't write in Jupyter notebook. My codes directly run as scripts with unit tests (*Test-Driven Development*, TDD).
1. Develop/refine the CI/CD pipeline. I use *Github Actions* or *Azure DevOps*.
1. Deploy the application or feature. I use *Kubernetes* for this.

To accelerate the development process above, I have my own code base where there are many components that can be reused.
For example, I have a code base for data processing, a code base for model development, a code base for deployment, and
so on. I put efforts into refining these code bases so that I can save more time for the development of the new feature.
But still, for any brand-new applications, I have to write lots of codes manually, particular, the **tests**.

With the AI-assisted coding...

I can probably just need to do the **first three steps** above! This leads to a significant gain of efficiency in the
development process. Moreover, I am not a full-stack programmer, so I can just focus on the interface and the core of
the application. I don't need to care about the programming language, the framework, nor the low-level details!

Well, the gain is not just for me. It is for nearly everyone that wants to develop software without a thorough
understanding of the low-level coding details. And amazingly, we saw the fantastic work from even kids who used AI to
generate codes for their projects (see below). With the adoption of the AI-assisted coding, the number of potential
programmers (e.g., non-computer science, non-engineering students) has increased dramatically. And truly building
software application has been democratized. And it's no longer the privilege of the computer science students or the
engineering professionals any more!

**But is it all good**?



### Emotional fulfillment as a programmer may not be there

![AI-assisted coding](https://compote.slate.com/images/fe8e6b45-1ea0-45db-ade4-7ce00647041b.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=840)
<font size="1">The character of a human in the movie "WALL-E". It pictures the futuristic human outlook when AI can do everything for humans. And due to that, the human becomes lazy and fat.</font>

After my initial excitement, one significant aspect that may be lost in the transition to AI-assisted coding is the
emotional fulfillment. I became "lazy" to work on a Vim-like environment any more after I found that an AI IDE like
Cursor can generate codes for me with just typing "tab" and "enter". The AI-based tool also diminishes my "pride" as a Vim programmer. Indeed, I can do things faster with auto-completion
but, that is not the coolness of me - it is that of the AI models. I may not be respected any more as a programmer that
can code fast with Vim - I am simply downgraded to be equivalent to an AI model that is tuned to just generate codes for
me. 

The picture below shows the IDE experience with Vim and its plugin, called `nerdtree`. See reference  
[here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/git-nerdtree) (it was created by
[@jistr](https://github.com/jistr) 10 years ago!).

![Vim IDE Setup by using nerdtree, airline, ctrlp and vim-startify](https://i.imgur.com/jSCwGjU.gif?1)
<font size="1">The above GIF shows the Vim IDE setup by using `nerdtree`, `airline`, `ctrlp` and `vim-startify` plugins.</font>

To achieve the above, assuming the plugin of `nerdtree` is installed, you can use the following steps:

Place this in your .vimrc:

```vim
Plugin 'xuyuanp/git-nerdtree'
```

then run the following in Vim:

```vim
:source %
:PluginInstall
```

Now this may be treated as a quite "manual" and "tedious" way of coding because AI can do everything for us. But the
fulfillment of joy from configuring a Vim IDE lasts much longer than that from developing an application with Cursor. 

While my fulfillment is from the use of the IDE for coding my own application, other programmers may have their own
fulfillment from other things. For example, some may find fulfillment from finding a more beautiful pattern to design a
data access layer, implementing a new algorithm with lower time complexity compared to the state-of-the-art, or
optimizing the data pipeline efficiency by introducing proper partition in the database tables. All of these joys, with
the use of AI-based tool, may be gone, because they don't need to and perhaps, don't want to think about these things. 

And this leads to the next point - AI programming tools may gradually erode
programmers' pursuit of technical depth and details without them realizing it.

### No more need for in-depth understanding about the low-level details

Think about the last time you were debugging a C or C++ code when the frustrating ["core dump" error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump) frequently occurs in
the console and you had to dig into the code to find the root cause day and night. And the debugging process requires
you to not just fix the bug with some "trials-and-errors" but to really understand the low-level details of the memory
management and system architecture. A similar situation presents for the coding exercise of a data scientist. In the
data science project, the AI-assistant can easily produce the codes for data transformation, feature engineering, etc.,
but the data scientists or data engineers will lose the opportunities to have an in-depth understanding of the best
practices in handling data with regard to the data I/O performance, analytics performance, and other aspects. 

The AI IDE also creates a significant impact on the technical interview process for programmers. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or
[Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) are the most popular platforms for programmers coding interviews. Though I am not a believer in the
effectiveness of the Leetcode-like platform for evaluating the programmer's skills, it is undeniable that it provides
programmers with the opportunities to practice and sharpen their skills on the low-level details of the programming. It
is very likely that the assessment of Leetcode questions are never practiced in the actual work. However, *the
programmers who are able to solve the problems correctly in the coding interviews are more likely to be the ones who are
able to perform well in the actual work*. And the good practices that have been developed in the Leetcode question
preparation will be beneficial to the programmers in the actual work as well. **NOTE** the purpose of practicing
Leetcode is definitely not to memorize the solutions to the problems like a machine - very apparently AI does better
than humans in this aspect. The Leetcode practice is to train the programmer's skills to think about the problems deeply
and to be creative with the solutions. After being used to the AI-based coding, the programmers may not be able to think
creatively and deeply like before. 

### Is coding a collaborative activity any more?

Like everyone else, I got impressed by the YouTube video above where a 8yo kid codes a simple application **by herself** with AI. There are tons of similar videos, blogs, and GitHub repositories where the creators want to demonstrate one thing - *AI can help programmer to easily handle the development of work solo projects*. My question then is: does it mean that collaboration on the code is no more needed, and a pair of human + AI is better than a pair of humans?

There are lots of rebuttal against the capability of AI to do large-scale collaborative projects. For example, the AI
may not be able to understand the context and the humor in the code, or the AI may not be able to collaborate with the
programmer to solve the problem. I accept that ["composer" in Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/blog/cursor-composer/) does
a great job in understanding not just the code but also the overall project context. This works for a solo project that
builds, say, an application that helps me manage my personal finance, arrange my travel with family, etc. But what about
the cases that the project is complex and requires multiple human programmers to collaborate with each other? Like a
recommender system that is used by a ecommerce company? I doubt the capability of the contemporary AI-based tool is
sufficient to a single program for the entire development.

Also, AI breaks the conventional workflow of the collaborative coding work that human
programmers have been following for decades. [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) (definitely [GitHub](https://github.com/), too) is one of the most popular tools for collaborative coding, and it is
not only useful to help *version control* but also help *collaboration* among a group of human programmers. There are
tools and practices for version control of the prompts that are used for generating codes, too (e.g.,
[Dify](https://dify.ai/), [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/getting_started/chat_with_chatgpt/),
[Pezzo](https://pezzo.dev/), etc., are examples of the LLMOps tools that help managee and version control the prompts).
Nevertheless, due to the nature of the LLMs, it is hard to reproduce exactly the same codes with the same prompt, and
the collaboration among the programmers may not be as straightforward as before.

### Responsibility and accountability?

The AI-based approach is different from the traditional approach in terms of *who is responsible for the code*. In the
traditional approach, the programmer is responsible for the code from the prompt to the solution. But with the AI-based
approach, the programmer is responsible for the prompt, and the AI is responsible for the code - what if the code has
issues? 

Again, this is the classic issue of any predictive model - *for any model that is probabilistic (apparently, this is
definite for all of the machine learning models where patterns are learnt from samples), there is no guarantee that the
model will produce the same output for the same input, and thus, the operationalization of the model should be overseen
by a human for accountability and responsibility*.

<div class="mermaid">

    B -->|"Code"| C[Application]
</div>
</html>

<font size="1">The above diagram shows the AI-based approach to programming. The programmer provides a prompt to the AI, and the AI generates code. The programmer is responsible for the prompt, and the AI is responsible for the code.</font>

One may say, the programmer is accountable for the codes because the the codes are generated from the prompts which are
provided by the programmer. But this seems not sensible, because the programmer may say, "The application actually runs
on the codes generated from the LLM, not my prompts". And the programmer may also say, "My prompts are not responsible
for the codes because no one can reproduce exactly the same codes with the same prompt!" In fact, these are valid
points. This is indeed neither a problem of the programmer nor the AI. It's about the *protocol* with which the model
should be used with sufficient ethical concerns. There are quite some good thoughts on this topic from the industry and
academia (see references below).

## What shall we do?

I believe that the AI-based programming tools will further evolve and become more sophisticated. There will be more
advanced tools that can help programmers to be more productive. And there will be more advanced tools that can help
programmers to be more creative. I don't have a anticipation on what it will be like.But I will still have my Vim plugin
installed in both VSCode (it is where I use [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/)) and Cursor. I am so used to
the Vim hotkeys and perhaps for my whole life I will use it. My Vim-based programming habits coexist with AI-based
programming assistance tools, ensuring that I retain a bit of the traditional programmer's dignity. But I don't know if
in a very near future, whether there will be another significant shift of the paradigm again about how humans "program"
(well can we still call it programming when it is done by AI? 😅). Hope I am not too pessimistic.
