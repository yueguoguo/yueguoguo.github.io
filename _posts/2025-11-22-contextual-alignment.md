## Introduction

### Background

Finding a perfect alignment of multiple parties to achieve something
cooperatively is non-trivial. It might become particularly hard when resolving
critical and complex problems in an organization - normally the AI solutions
require properly processed data, robust infrastructure framework, clear defined
business objectives, talents, ethical concerns, responsibility for
organizational and societal goods, etc. - all of these become the parts that
require alignment and then cooperation. 

The thing is, we may not often need a global alignment among the collaborators.
And if there is an efficient way to achieve the goal *just sufficiently*, the
extra efforts are unnecessary. This idea has been reflected by many theoretical
research as well as pragmatic implementations. For instance, in the behavioral
economics, *incentivization* is the key term to describe the *reflective* part
of human cognitive system, where the analysis based on the available information
to behave that maximizes the best interests in the outcome. And apparently, due
to the differences of the individual natures, the best interests vary. And thus,
the behavior of the individuals being exposed to even the same environment
differ, too. And, if the overall organization asks these individuals with
different interests to achieve the same goal, alignment is then needed. The AI
researchers have interpreted the same concept into the *contextual modelling* or
*situated cognition* to describe the reactions of an AI agent at the
circumstances where the agent needs to maximizes the probability to achieve its
goal. 

Given the differences of the individuals' nature, aligning all of the best
interests take time, and the efforts for that may grow non-linearly with the
number of parties involved and also the environmental factors that need to be
considered. What is more, there is no strict need of such global alignment to
achieve the goal, and sometimes, a bare minimum intersection of the common
interests would boost the achievement, as long as these common interests can be
at least proportionally projected onto the direction of the common goal. 

### A parent-child dilemma

An epic headache to all the parents is to find alignment with children on
something that is viewed differently by adult and kid. For example, my wife or I
often argue with my 3 year-old daughter about the screen time of TV, and this is
what it usually happens. 

* I
> You have spent too much time on watching TV. You need to cut it down.

* My daughter
> My friend (the boy lives next door) also watches TV and I want to watch it,
> too. 

And the context for us is

* **My context**: worried about her eyesight, sleep, focus, and health.
* **My daughter's context**: happy with cartoon, colorful scenes, characters,
  and stories to share with friends.

The incentive for us, respectively, are 
* **Care for my daughter to have a long-term healthy growth**.
* **Have an enjoyable period of time with the cartoon**.

In this scenario, I think most of the parents would know the best strategy - use
a timer. It does work and the thought process behind the approach is
* *Take the contextual information from both parties* - worries about health and
  joy of watching cartoon. 
* *Find the incentives for both* - watch less cartoon and watch more cartoon.
* *Seek for an intersection to achieve the contextual alignment* - agree on a
  time limit that both are happy with. 
* *Sometimes, handle the probabilistic exceptions with trade-offs* - watch time
  on birthday can be prolonged.

Hence, alignment is never global or universal, it is **contextual** and situated
in tasks, data, constraints, incentives, many possibly many other factors in the
environment.
